# .gitignore Explanation

This document explains what files are ignored and why.

## Root Level (.gitignore)

**What's ignored:**
- OS files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, etc.)
- IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.)
- Environment variables (`.env` files - **CRITICAL**)
- Build artifacts (`dist/`, `build/`)
- Dependencies (`node_modules/`)
- Logs and temporary files

**Why:**
- OS/IDE files are user-specific and not needed in repo
- Environment variables contain secrets - **NEVER commit these!**
- Build artifacts are generated and can be rebuilt
- Dependencies can be reinstalled with `npm install` or `flutter pub get`

## Server (.gitignore)

**What's ignored:**
- `node_modules/` - npm packages (reinstall with `npm install`)
- `dist/` - TypeScript compiled output (generated by `npm run build`)
- `.env` files - **NEVER commit secrets!**
- Logs and cache files
- TypeScript build info

**Why:**
- All of these are either generated or contain sensitive information
- Can be recreated from source code

## Client (.gitignore)

**What's ignored:**
- `.dart_tool/` - Dart tooling cache
- `.flutter-plugins*` - Flutter plugin files
- `.packages` - Package resolution cache
- `build/` - **All build output** (web, android, ios, etc.)
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports
- IDE files

**Why:**
- Build output is generated from source code
- Tooling files are regenerated automatically
- Test coverage can be regenerated

## Important Notes

### ✅ DO Commit:
- Source code (`.dart`, `.ts`, `.js` files)
- Configuration files (`pubspec.yaml`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`)
- Documentation (`.md` files)
- Assets that are part of the game (sprites, sounds, etc.)

### ❌ DON'T Commit:
- `.env` files (contain secrets!)
- `node_modules/` (can be huge, reinstall with `npm install`)
- `build/` or `dist/` folders (generated files)
- IDE settings (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- OS files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

## Checking What Will Be Committed

Before committing, check what will be added:

```powershell
# See what files are tracked/untracked
git status

# See what would be committed
git status --short

# See detailed file list
git ls-files
```

## If You Accidentally Committed Something

If you accidentally committed a file that should be ignored:

```powershell
# Remove from git but keep local file
git rm --cached <file>

# Or remove entire folder
git rm -r --cached <folder>

# Then commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove ignored files"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - These contain secrets!
2. **Never commit `node_modules/`** - Too large, can be reinstalled
3. **Never commit `build/` folders** - Generated files
4. **Check before committing** - Use `git status` first

## Files That Might Be Questionable

- `char-1.png` - If this is a game asset, it should be committed. If it's a test file, add to `.gitignore`
- `package-lock.json` - Usually should be committed (locks dependency versions)
- `.vscode/` - Usually ignored, but you might want to share settings
